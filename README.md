# GeoGuessor üåç

GeoGuessor is an interactive web game that challenges users to guess locations on a world map. Using Firebase for user authentication and data storage, players can track their high scores, view their ranks on the leaderboard, and explore a variety of locations. The goal is to identify a place by analyzing the images and clues given, then mark your guess on the map. The closer you are, the higher you score!
